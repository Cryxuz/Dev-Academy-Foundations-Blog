      <h1 class="problem-solving-h1"><strong>Javascript Kata</strong></h1>
      <br />
      <p class="problem-solving-p">
        The term "kata" in the context of coding challenges or exercises was
        originally derived from martial arts. In martial arts, kata refers to a
        choreographed sequence of movements used for training and practice. The
        concept of kata was then adapted to programming to describe small coding
        exercises that developers can practice to improve their skills and
        problem-solving abilities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="problem-solving-p">
        During the week, I engaged in JavaScript kata exercises to boost my
        skills. I approached the challenges with enthusiasm, employing various
        techniques and problem-solving strategies. It was an enriching
        experience that expanded my knowledge of JavaScript.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 class="problem-solving-h2">Problem Solving</h2>
      <p class="problem-solving-p">
        I really had a challenging experience with the JavaScript Kata gradebook
        exercise. It involved transferring array values into object literals,
        and I struggled for quite some time. I sought help from a facilitator
        and employed techniques like rubber duck debugging and pseudocode. It
        was a mix of frustration and enjoyment. Seeing the tests pass brought
        satisfaction. The exercise taught me patience, perseverance, and the
        importance of taking breaks and meditating to relieve stress and refresh
        my mind.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 class="problem-solving-h2">When I elegantly solve a problem.</h2>
      <p class="problem-solving-p">
        I may not deem it elegant, but I managed to complete the
        concatMyArray.js exercise without resorting to the workshop or seeking
        help from my facilitator. The task involved creating a function to
        concatenate individual strings within an array into a single string.
        Employing pseudocode and the rubber duck technique, I conversed with my
        storm trooper to systematically approach and break down the problem.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2 class="problem-solving-h2">
        How confident I am using each problem-solving techniques.
      </h2>
      <p class="problem-solving-p">
        <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I love this method, it allows me to outline
        the logic and steps needed to solve a problem without getting caught up
        in specific syntax. Breaking down the problem into smaller steps through
        pseudocode enables a more systematic approach, making it easier to
        tackle and implement each step accurately.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="problem-solving-p">
        <strong
          >Console logging, reading error messages, googling and trying
          something: </strong
        >I frequently rely on console logging, error message analysis, and
        experimentation. As a routine practice, I execute my pseudocode steps
        within the web browser console, utilizing console.log() to track
        progress. If an issue arises, the error message precisely identifies the
        problem's location, prompting me to search for alternative solutions
        using online resources like Google. This iterative process allows me to
        explore different approaches and attempt different solutions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p class="problem-solving-p">
        <strong>Asking peers and coaches for help:</strong>Seeking assistance
        from peers and coaches is my final resort, as I strive to minimize
        reliance on external help. I am aware that beyond the course,
        independent problem-solving becomes crucial. Therefore, I proactively
        tackle challenges on my own. Only when I encounter prolonged
        difficulties in seemingly straightforward exercises, I reach out to my
        facilitator and homegroup for support.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 class="problem-solving-h2">
        The time I was reluctant to ask for help:
      </h2>
      <p class="problem-solving-p">
        At times, I experience reluctance in seeking help because I have already
        asked for assistance in previous exercises, and I don't want to impose
        or burden my facilitator, considering their busy schedule.

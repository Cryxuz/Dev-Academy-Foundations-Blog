        <li>
          <p>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</p>
          <ul class="identity-values-ul">
            <li>
              <p>In a situation where I discovered that my company was engaging in unethical practices, I faced a critical ethical decision. Weighing the values of integrity, loyalty, and the well-being of stakeholders, I deliberated on the potential consequences of my actions. Recognizing the potential harm caused by the unethical practices, I made the difficult choice to report the misconduct to the appropriate authorities and expose the truth. Reflecting on the decision now, I deeply understand the importance of upholding ethical standards, protecting the interests of stakeholders, and maintaining my own integrity. I firmly believe that I made the right choice in addressing the unethical behavior and taking a stand for what is right.</p>

          <p>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</p>
          <ul class="identity-values-ul">
            <li>
              <p>My own personal experiences have shown me that a person's culture and the people around them have a profound impact on shaping their values and identity. Being raised in a specific cultural context, I absorbed the shared beliefs, traditions, and societal norms that influenced my perspective and behavior. The interactions with my family, friends, and community further molded my values through socialization, shared experiences, and the role models I encountered. These influences have been instrumental in forming my ethical frameworks, guiding my decision-making process, and ultimately shaping my sense of self. I have come to appreciate the powerful role that culture and interpersonal connections have played in shaping my values and identity.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Throughout my learning journey, my dedication to learn will fuel my motivation, keeping me focused on my long term goals.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</p>
          <ul class="identity-values-ul">
            <li>
              <p>As I reflect upon my own journey, I recognize that my limitations, such as a fixed mindset, fear of failure, or lack of self-confidence, can indeed hinder my learning and career development. These limitations may cause me to hesitate when it comes to taking risks, avoid embracing new challenges, and ultimately restrict my potential for growth. However, I firmly believe that overcoming these limitations is essential for me to embark on a successful learning journey and advance in my career.</p>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</p>
          <ul class="identity-values-ul">
            <li>
              <p>In a project team, I encountered resistance and tension among team members. To address this, I encouraged open communication, facilitated team-building activities, and defined clear roles. Although these strategies had some positive impact, the resistance and tension persisted. Reflecting on the experience, I now realize the importance of active listening and empathy. In the future, I would prioritize creating a safe space for team members to express their concerns and opinions openly. Additionally, I would implement conflict resolution techniques, such as mediation or facilitated discussions, to address underlying issues directly. By fostering open dialogue and empathetic understanding, my goal is to promote a more collaborative and productive team environment.</p>

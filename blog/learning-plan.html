                I am determined to make every effort to secure employment in
                renowned companies such as Xero, Datacom, Chorus, Spark, One NZ,
                and 2degrees. My goal is to gain valuable experience from their
                teams and eventually become a proficient full-stack developer
                within a decade.

                When faced with numerous distractions, I struggle to maintain
                focus; however, one of my notable strengths is my unwavering
                perseverance. I persistently strive towards my objectives
                without giving up until they are accomplished.

                One of the major hurdles I anticipate encountering during the
                bootcamp revolves around my ability to effectively communicate
                and present in front of a group. This particular challenge of
                public speaking has been an area that I find particularly
                daunting and will require additional effort and practice to
                overcome.

              <p>
                Developing the skill to confidently address and engage a sizable
                audience is a task I perceive as my most significant challenge
                within the bootcamp. The prospect of effectively delivering
                presentations or speeches in front of a group of people is an
                area that I recognize as requiring substantial improvement and
                dedicated practice. Acquiring the ability to articulate my
                thoughts, express ideas, and connect with the audience in a
                persuasive manner is an essential objective that I am determined
                to accomplish throughout the course of the bootcamp.

                My expectation of the Bootcamp team is that they consistently
                provide us with unwavering support and guidance throughout the
                program. I anticipate that they will be readily available
                whenever we require assistance, offering their expertise and
                resources to help us overcome challenges and maximize our
                learning experience. It is my hope that the team will
                demonstrate a strong commitment to our growth, fostering a
                positive and inclusive environment where we feel comfortable
                seeking their guidance and advice.

              In the Bootcamp, I have high expectations of myself to come
              through and make the most out of this opportunity for growth and
              learning. To meet these expectations, I will prioritize effective
              time management by proactively planning ahead and organizing my
              tasks and responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              To ensure I receive timely assistance, I will actively engage with
              my fellow learners, leveraging the collaborative nature of the
              Bootcamp to seek help and guidance when required.
            </p>
            <p>
              In managing my workload during the program, I am committed to
              fostering a productive and safe environment for myself and others.
              This entails demonstrating respect, open communication, and
              collaboration with fellow learners, facilitators, and
              industry/community representatives. I will actively listen to
              others, contribute constructively to discussions, and embrace
              diverse perspectives. By maintaining a positive and inclusive
              attitude, I aim to create a conducive learning atmosphere that
              promotes mutual growth and success.
